### About the Data
**Data Source:** http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ - the data, updated upto January 2024 at the time of access, provides detailed information about Airbnb listings, hosts, prices, room types, location, etc.
   
The data utilized in this dashboard consisted of of 91778 unique rows of data. There were data quality issues such as missing values and outliers, and I applied data cleaning processes to ensure accuracy and reliability in analysis. The final cleaned dataset with:

- no duplicate entries,
- missing values treated,
- outliers treated and
- columns appropriately treated to extract information about beds, bedrooms, star ratings, etc.

was used to create the Power BI dashboard. 

**User-Friendly Interface:** The dashboard features an intuitive and visually appealing interface designed to facilitate ease of navigation and interaction for users with varying levels of technical expertise. 

### Concluding Remarks
1. The concentration of listings in key neighbourhoods in London, coupled with nuanced pricing patterns, highlights the dynamic nature of Airbnbs in the city.
2. Using such a dashboard, travellers can gain a better understanding of the factors influencing Airbnb costs so that they can find something that suits their budget.
