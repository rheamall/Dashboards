# Customer Analysis Dashboard

### Objective

This dashboard provides insights into customer purchasing behavior, spending patterns and geographical distribution. I built it using Looker Studio with data from five joined tables, and it features interactive visualizations highlighting top customers, peak ordering months and regional sales distribution. 

There are dynamic filtering options for customer, product category and country, to enable users to drill down into specific segments, uncover trends, and make informed decisions to optimize sales and customer engagement.

### Demonstration

### About the Data

Northwind Traders Database - https://github.com/pthom/northwind_psql/tree/master

This is an extension of the [Northwind Traders SQL Analysis project](https://github.com/rheamall/Northwind-Traders-SQL-Analysis) that I worked on with my colleague Ayush. In this project, we explored data insights through complex queries, joins and CTEs. Our analysis was focused on 4 key areas: sales revenue, customer behavior, suppliers and operational efficiency, to derive actionable insights for business improvement.
